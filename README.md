# MoreEyesSDK
Unity editor tools for creating MoreEyes mods for R.E.P.O.


## WIP

- We'll add some pictures to the github in a folder for easier navigation
- For now if you want to create your own:
  - Follow the steps of [R.E.P.O. Project Patcher by Kesomannen](https://github.com/Kesomannen/unity-repo-project-patcher)
  - Add our package `https://github.com/darmuh/MoreEyesSDK.git` to your unity project
  - Press on the `+` -> `MoreEyes` -> `Ë™Mod` in your preferred folder and then fill out this Scriptable Object (SO for short)
  - Once you are done, at the top of your project (File,Edit,Assets...etc) there is going to be a `More Eyes` button, click on that and then `Package Mods`, select your preferred folder and build it
  - Once you are done with this, just follow [Thunderstore's instructions](https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs) and you can also use [Thunderstore's Markdown Preview](https://thunderstore.io/tools/markdown-preview) for your readme and also make sure your manifest has our mod as a dependency
 
### More info

-  Please if you are uploading a mod give players some basic informations like a list of what it contains, some pictures even `![](imgur or other website's link where you placed your picture)`
