## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

- Example pictures will be added to the repo soon for easier navigation.
- For now, you can create your own mod by following the steps below.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup & Usage

1. Follow the setup guide for [R.E.P.O. Project Patcher by Kesomannen](https://github.com/Kesomannen/unity-repo-project-patcher).
2. Add this package to your Unity project: `https://github.com/darmuh/MoreEyesSDK.git`
3. In the Unity editor, press **`+` or `Right Click` inside a folder â†’ MoreEyes â†’ Ë™Mod** in your preferred folder.
4. Fill out the generated **ScriptableObject (SO)** with your modâ€™s details.
5. Once ready, at the top of the editor youâ€™ll find a **More Eyes** menu:
- Click **More Eyes** â†’ **Package Mods**
- Select your preferred folder
- Build the package
6. After building, follow [Thunderstoreâ€™s instructions](https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs) for publishing your mod.
- You can also preview your README using [Thunderstoreâ€™s Markdown Preview](https://thunderstore.io/tools/markdown-preview).
- Be sure your `manifest.json` lists [our mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/s1ckboy/MoreEyes )'s dependency string.

## Naming convention for prefabs

- `cat_pupil_right`
- `cat_pupil_left`
- `cat_iris_right`
- `cat_iris_left`
- _both should also work, but I havent really tested that yet - Darmuh might have, I'll polish out this readme soon
